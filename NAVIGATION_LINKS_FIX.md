# 🔗 Navigation Links Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## 📋 Problem
The Quick Navigation Cards on the Enhanced Student Dashboard were linking to routes that didn't exist, causing broken page errors when users clicked on:
- Performance Card → `/student/performance` ❌
- Quiz Card → `/student/quizzes` ❌
- Exercices Card → `/student/exercises` ❌

### 2. Added Routes to App.jsx

```javascript
// New protected routes added
<Route 
  path="/student/performance" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <StudentPerformance />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>

<Route 
  path="/student/quizzes" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <StudentQuizzes />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>

<Route 
  path="/student/exercises" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <StudentExercises />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>
```

## 🎨 User Interface

### Quick Navigation Cards (Dashboard)
```

### Page Headers
Each new page includes:
