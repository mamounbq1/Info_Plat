## ✅ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND & FIXED

### **Issue #1: Missing Quiz Taking Page** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - ✅ **FIXED**

**Problem**:
- Route `/quiz/:quizId` was referenced in `AvailableQuizzes.jsx` (lines 221, 339)
- **Page did not exist** - students got 404 error when clicking "Start Quiz"
- This broke the entire quiz functionality

**Solution**:
- ✅ Created `QuizTaking.jsx` (14647 characters, 391 lines)
- ✅ Added route `/quiz/:quizId` to `App.jsx`
- ✅ Implemented full quiz-taking interface with:
  - Question-by-question navigation
  - Timer with auto-submit
  - Progress indicator
  - Answer selection with visual feedback
  - Submit confirmation dialog
  - Save attempts to Firestore
  - Navigate to results page after submission

**Impact**: **HIGH** - Core functionality restored
