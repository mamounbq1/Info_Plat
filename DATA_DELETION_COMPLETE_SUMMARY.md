## 🚀 How to Delete All Data

### ✅ METHOD 1: Firebase Console (RECOMMENDED)

**This is the easiest and most reliable method!**

1. **Open Firestore Console:**
   🔗 https://console.firebase.google.com/project/eduinfor-fff3d/firestore/data

2. **Delete each collection:**
   - Click on collection name (e.g., "users")
   - Click three dots (⋮) menu
   - Select "Delete collection"
   - Type collection name to confirm
   - Click "Delete"

3. **Repeat for these collections:**
   - users (24 docs)
   - courses (19 docs)
   - quizzes (11 docs)
   - exercises (10 docs)
   - branches (4 docs)
   - subjects (11 docs)

4. **Verify deletion:**
   ```bash
   node check-database-contents.js
   ```

**⏱️ Time required:** 5-10 minutes  
**✅ Success rate:** 100%  
**🔒 Requirements:** None (you're the owner)

### METHOD 2: Using Scripts

#### Option A: Simple Script
```bash
node delete-all-simple.js
```

#### Option B: Interactive Script
```bash
node delete-all-data.js
# Type "DELETE ALL DATA" when prompted
```

#### Option C: Admin SDK Script
```bash
# First, download service account key
# Then run:
node delete-all-data-admin.js
```

---

## 🔍 Why Scripts Show "Permission Denied"

The scripts are currently failing because:

1. The deployed Firestore rules are more restrictive than the local file
2. The client SDK requires authentication
3. The rules need to be either:
   - Temporarily opened for deletion, OR
   - Bypassed using Firebase Admin SDK with service account

**Solution:** Use the Firebase Console method (Method 1) - it always works!

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

- ❌ Deletion is **IRREVERSIBLE** - there is no undo
- 💾 Backup data first if you might need it later
- 🔑 Firestore deletion doesn't delete Authentication users
- 📦 Firestore deletion doesn't delete Storage files
- 🔒 After deletion, deploy secure Firestore rules
