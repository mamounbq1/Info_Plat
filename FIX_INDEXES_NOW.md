Wait 5-10 minutes, then refresh your app.

## 📋 What's Missing?

You're getting these errors because 2 indexes are missing:

### ❌ Error 1: Quizzes Index
```
Collection: quizzes
Fields: createdBy (ASC) + createdAt (DESC)
```

**Why?** TeacherDashboard queries quizzes by teacher's name:
```javascript
where('createdBy', '==', userProfile?.fullName)
orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
```

### ❌ Error 2: Exercises Permission (Actually needs index too)
```
Collection: exercises  
Fields: createdBy (ASC) + createdAt (DESC)
```

**Why?** TeacherDashboard queries exercises by teacher's name:
```javascript
where('createdBy', '==', userProfile?.fullName)
orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
```

## ✅ Already Added to firestore.indexes.json

I've already updated your `firestore.indexes.json` file with both missing indexes:
- ✅ quizzes: `createdBy` + `createdAt`
- ✅ exercises: `createdBy` + `createdAt`

**Now you just need to deploy them!**

---

## 🎯 Choose Your Method

### Method 1: Click Error Link ⚡ (Fastest - 30 seconds)
- Click the link in the error message
- Create the index
- **Repeat for both errors** (quizzes and exercises)

### Method 2: Firebase CLI 🔧 (Best - deploys all at once)
```bash
npx firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

### Method 3: Manual in Firebase Console 🖱️
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Project: **eduinfor-fff3d**
3. Firestore Database → Indexes
4. Create both indexes manually

---

## 🔍 Verify Success

After deployment, check Firebase Console:
- Go to: **Firestore Database** → **Indexes** tab
- Look for:
  - ✅ `quizzes` with `createdBy` + `createdAt` - Status: **Enabled** (green)
  - ✅ `exercises` with `createdBy` + `createdAt` - Status: **Enabled** (green)

Then refresh your app - errors should be gone! 🎉

## ⏱️ How Long?

- **Index building**: 2-10 minutes (depending on data size)
- **Empty collections**: Instant
- **Your collections**: Probably 2-5 minutes since they're new

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

After clicking the error link or deploying, **DON'T close the Firebase Console tab**. You can watch the index status change from "Building" (yellow) to "Enabled" (green).
